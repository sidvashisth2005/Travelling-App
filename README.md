## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Running

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sidvashisth2005/Travelling-App.git

     - `travel_advisor_host`: `travel-advisor.p.rapidapi.com`
     - `travel_advisor_base_url`: `https://travel-advisor.p.rapidapi.com`
     - `huggingface_api_key`: Your Hugging Face Inference API key (with Inference permission)
     - `huggingface_model_url`: e.g. `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/microsoft/DialoGPT-medium`

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## üîë API Keys & Dynamic Config
- **All API keys, hosts, and model URLs are stored in Firebase Firestore** under `config/api_keys`.
- The app fetches these at startup, so you can update keys or endpoints without redeploying.
- **TripAdvisor RapidAPI:** Used for places and hotels data
- **OpenStreetMap Nominatim:** Used for reverse geocoding and landmarks (no key required)
- **Hugging Face Inference API:** Used for AI chatbot (key and model URL from Firestore)
- **Firebase:** Used for authentication and config storage

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Map & Geocoding
- **Maps:** Uses [flutter_map](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map) for embedded OpenStreetMap views (no key required)
- **Directions:** Uses [url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher) to open Google Maps for navigation
- **Landmarks:** Uses Nominatim reverse geocoding to find and display nearby famous places

---

## ü§ñ AI Chatbot
- Powered by Hugging Face Inference API (e.g., DialoGPT, Blenderbot)
- Model and API key are fetched from Firestore
- Copy-to-clipboard: Long-press any chat message to copy
- Handles API/network errors gracefully

## üß∞ Troubleshooting
- **API errors:** Check your API keys and network connection
- **Map not loading:** Ensure you have internet access and the correct dependencies
- **Firebase issues:** Make sure your config files and Firestore rules are correct
- **Rate limits:** Nominatim and TripAdvisor APIs have rate limits; use responsibly
- **Firestore permissions:**
  - For development, use:
    ```
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /config/api_keys {
          allow read: if true;
          allow write: if false;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - For production, restrict read access as needed
